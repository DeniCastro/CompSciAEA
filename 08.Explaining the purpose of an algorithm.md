# The purpose of an algorithm  
An algorithm sets out the steps to complete a given task. This is usually shown as a flowchart or pseudocode, so that the purpose of the task and the processes needed to complete it are clear to those who study it.  

You will be able to practise this skill as you become more familiar with writing and finding and correcting errors in algorithms.
