## Concepts

So far, you have tested your algorithms by dry-running. Once you have written a program for your algorithm, and when there are no syntax errors, you will now use a computer to run the program to complete the task exactly as you have written it; you may need to make some changes before it works exactly as you intend it to.

This chapter will introduce you to the programming concepts required for practical use of a high-level language. This chapter shows the concepts behind such programming languages but should be used in conjunction with learning the syntax of an appropriate programming language.

There are many high-level programming languages to choose from. For IGCSE Computer Science, the high-level programming languages recommended are **Python**, **Visual Basic**, or **Java**. The use of these languages is also required for A Level Computer Science.

Many programming languages need an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** to write and run code. IDEs are free to download and use.

# Introduction to Python for IGCSE

## Why Python?
Python will be the primary programming language used in this IGCSE course because:
- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it ideal for beginners.
- **Versatile**: It is used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **Wide Community Support**: Python has a large community, so finding help and resources is easy.
- **Free and Open Source**: Python is free to use and distribute.

## Basic Data Types in Python

Python supports several data types. Here are the most common ones:

### 1. **Integer (`int`)**
- Represents whole numbers (positive or negative).
- Example:
  ```python
  age = 15
  print(age)  # Output: 15


### 2. Float (float)
Represents decimal numbers.

Example:

python
Copy
height = 1.75
print(height)  # Output: 1.75
3. String (str)
Represents text enclosed in single or double quotes.

Example:

python
Copy
name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Output: Alice
4. Boolean (bool)
Represents True or False values.

Example:

python
Copy
is_student = True
print(is_student)  # Output: True
5. List (list)
Represents an ordered collection of items (can contain different data types).

Example:

python
Copy
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
6. Dictionary (dict)
Represents a collection of key-value pairs.

Example:

python
Copy
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 15}
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 15}
Example Programs
Example 1: Using Integers and Floats
python
Copy
# Calculate the area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 5.5
area = length * width
print("Area:", area)  # Output: Area: 55.0
Example 2: Using Strings
python
Copy
# Greet the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)  # Output: Hello, [user's name]
Example 3: Using Lists
python
Copy
# Print a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
Summary
Python is a beginner-friendly and versatile programming language.

Common data types in Python include int, float, str, bool, list, and dict.

These data types allow you to work with numbers, text, and collections of data.
