## Concepts

So far, you have tested your algorithms by dry-running. Once you have written a program for your algorithm, and when there are no syntax errors, you will now use a computer to run the program to complete the task exactly as you have written it; you may need to make some changes before it works exactly as you intend it to.

This chapter will introduce you to the programming concepts required for practical use of a high-level language. This chapter shows the concepts behind such programming languages but should be used in conjunction with learning the syntax of an appropriate programming language.

There are many high-level programming languages to choose from. For IGCSE Computer Science, the high-level programming languages recommended are **Python**, **Visual Basic**, or **Java**. The use of these languages is also required for A Level Computer Science.

Many programming languages need an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** to write and run code. IDEs are free to download and use.
