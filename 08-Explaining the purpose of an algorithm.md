# The purpose of an algorithm  
An algorithm sets out the steps to complete a given task. This is usually shown as a flowchart or pseudocode, so that the purpose of the task and the processes needed to complete it are clear to those who study it.  

You will be able to practise this skill as you become more familiar with writing and finding and correcting errors in algorithms.

## Secion 7.4 Standard methods of solution  
The ability to repeat existing methods is very important in the design of algorithms; when an algorithm is turned into a program the same methods may be repeated many thousands of times.  
You need to be able to use and understand these standard methods used in algorithms:  
- Totalling  
- Counting  
- Finding maximum, minimum, and average (mean) values
- Sorting using a bubble sort.
  
All the standard methods of solution are shown as pseudocode algorithms and will be used to practise program writing in the next chapter.  

## Totalling  
Totalling means keeping a total that values are added to. For example, keeping a running total of the marks awarded to each student in a class.

## Counting  
Keeping a count of the number of times an action is performed is another standard method. For example, counting the number of students that were awarded a pass mark:

 Counting is also used to count down until a certain value is reached, for example, checking the number of items in stock in a supermarket:
