# Flow Lines

Flow chart flow lines use arrows to show the direction of flow, which is usually, but not always, top to bottom and left to right.

### Example 4: Concert Ticket Sales

Tickets are sold for a concert at $20 each, if 10 tickets are brought then the discount is 10%, if 20 tickets are bought the discount it 20%. No more than 25 tickets can be bought in a single transaction.  

This is flowchart showing an algorithm to calculate the cost of buying a given number of tickets:

# Pseudocode  
**Pseudocode** is a simple method of showing an algorithm. It describes what the algorithm does by using English key words that are very similar to those used in a high-level programming language. Data items to be processed by the algorithm are given meaningful names in the same way that varialbles and constants are in a high-level programming language. However, pseudocode is not bound by the strict syntax rules of a programming language. It does what its name says, it pretends to be programming code!  

To ensure that pseudocode is easily understandable by others it is useful to be consistent in the way that it is written.  

The pseudocodde in this book is written in the following way to match the pseudocode given in the IGCSE Computer Science syllabus and to hel you understand the algorithms more easily:  

- a non-proportional font is used throughout
- all keywords  (words used to describe a specific action e.g. INPUT) are written in capital letters
- all names given to data items and subroutines start with a capital letter
- where conditional and loop statements are used, repeated or selected statements are indented by two spaces.
