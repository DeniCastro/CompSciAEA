# Understanding Primary Keys and SQL

## What Is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to **communicate with relational databases**. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently.

SQL is supported by most relational database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite.

## Core SQL Capabilities

SQL allows you to perform a wide range of actions. The most common categories are:

| Category             | Purpose                                      | Example Commands                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Data Definition**  | Define or alter the structure of a database  | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`               |
| **Data Manipulation**| Add, update, or delete records               | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`            |
| **Data Querying**    | Retrieve data from tables                    | `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`   |
| **Data Control**     | Manage access and permissions                | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                        |

## SQL Statement Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

```

# What Is a Primary Key?  
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity.  

## Key Characteristics of a Primary Key:   
Must contain unique values.  

Cannot contain NULL values.  

Each table should have only one primary key.  

Can consist of one or more columns (composite key).  

## Why Are Primary Keys Important?    
- Prevent duplicate records.   

- Ensure data integrity.  

- Enable efficient joins and indexing.

- Used as a reference in relationships with other tables (foreign keys).

## Defining a Primary Key  
Example 1: Single-column Primary Key  
```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```
