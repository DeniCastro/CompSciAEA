# Understanding Primary Keys and SQL

## What Is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to **communicate with relational databases**. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently.

SQL is supported by most relational database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite.

## Core SQL Capabilities

SQL allows you to perform a wide range of actions. The most common categories are:

| Category             | Purpose                                      | Example Commands                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Data Definition**  | Define or alter the structure of a database  | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`               |
| **Data Manipulation**| Add, update, or delete records               | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`            |
| **Data Querying**    | Retrieve data from tables                    | `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`   |
| **Data Control**     | Manage access and permissions                | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                        |

## SQL Statement Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

```

# What Is a Primary Key?  
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity.  

## Key Characteristics of a Primary Key:   
Must contain unique values.  

Cannot contain NULL values.  

Each table should have only one primary key.  

Can consist of one or more columns (composite key).  

## Why Are Primary Keys Important?    
- Prevent duplicate records.   

- Ensure data integrity.  

- Enable efficient joins and indexing.

- Used as a reference in relationships with other tables (foreign keys).

## Defining a Primary Key  
Example 1: Single-column Primary Key  
```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## Composite Primary Key

A **composite primary key** is a primary key made up of **two or more columns**. It is used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify each record.

### Example: Composite Key in a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```
## Inserting and Querying Data with Primary Keys  
Insert Example  
```
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email)
VALUES (1, 'Alice Smith', 'alice@example.com');
```
## SQL Operators and Their Use  
SQL supports various operators that are commonly used in WHERE clauses and other parts of queries to filter or compare data.  

## Comparison Operators  
| Operator | Description              | Example                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| =        | Equal to                 | `WHERE age = 25`           |
| !=       | Not equal to             | `WHERE department != 'HR'` |
| >        | Greater than             | `WHERE salary > 50000`     |
| <        | Less than                | `WHERE age < 30`           |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | `WHERE grade >= 85`        |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | `WHERE rating <= 4.5`      |  

## Logical operators  
| Operator | Description                                | Example                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| AND      | True if **both** conditions are true       | `WHERE age > 18 AND country = 'USA'` |
| OR       | True if **at least one** condition is true | `WHERE age < 18 OR status = 'guest'` |
| NOT      | Reverses the condition                     | `WHERE NOT (status = 'inactive')`    |  

## Other Useful operators  
| Operator | Description                                | Example                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| AND      | True if **both** conditions are true       | `WHERE age > 18 AND country = 'USA'` |
| OR       | True if **at least one** condition is true | `WHERE age < 18 OR status = 'guest'` |
| NOT      | Reverses the condition                     | `WHERE NOT (status = 'inactive')`    |

## Additional Example: Using Primary Key with Foreign Key  
```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);  
```

In this case:  

customer_id is the primary key in the customers table.  

In the orders table, customer_id is a foreign key, referencing the customer that placed the order.  

## Summary  
- A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.  

- Composite keys consist of two or more columns used together to create uniqueness.  

- Primary keys help maintain data integrity and are often referenced by foreign keys in related tables.  

- SQL provides various operators to help filter, compare, and manipulate data effectively.  

- Using proper keys and constraints improves both performance and reliability in database design.
