# Step-by-Step Guide to Create and View a SQLite Table on sqliteonline.com

This tutorial is designed for beginners who want to learn how to create, populate, and view a SQLite table using [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/). We will create a table called clients with columns id, name, and email, insert data, and display it. All commands are presented in the correct order, with simple explanations.

## Prerequisites
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Access to [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/).
- No prior SQL knowledge is required, but you should know how to copy and paste commands.

## Steps

### 1. Access sqliteonline.com
- Open your browser and go to [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/).
- Ensure the database selected at the top is *SQLite* (usually selected by default). Click *Connect* if needed.
- The left panel (with the house icon) is where you paste SQL commands. The right panel shows the results.

### 2. Create the clients table
We will create a table called clients with three columns:
- id: An integer that auto-increments (primary key).
- name: The client's name (text, required).
- email: The client's email (text, optional).

In the left panel, paste the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT
);
```
### Explanation:  
- CREATE TABLE clients: Creates a table named clients.  
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT: A column id with auto-incrementing integers (1, 2, 3...)  
- name TEXT NOT NULL: A column name for text, which cannot be empty.  
- email TEXT: A column email for text, which can be empty.  

Highlight the command (click and drag) or leave it as is.  
Click Run (or press F5).  
Expected result: The right panel shows "Query executed successfully". In the left panel, under DB Schema, the clients table should appear.  

## 3: Insert Data into the table  
Now, let's add some data into the clients table. In the left pannel, paste:
```
INSERT INTO clients (name, email) VALUES 
('John Smith', 'john@email.com'),
('Mary Johnson', 'mary@email.com'),
('Peter Brown', 'peter@email.com');
```
###Explanation:  
- This command inserts three rows into the clients table with names and emails.  
- Highlight the command and click Run.  
- Expected result: The right panel shows "Query executed successfully".  

## View the table  
To display the data, paste in the left pannel:
```
SELECT * FROM clients;
```
- Explanation: SELECT * FROM clients retrieves all columns and rows from the clients table.  
- Highlight the command and click Run.  
- Expected result: The right panel displays the table with the data:

```
id | name           | email
1  | John Smith     | john@email.com
2  | Mary Johnson   | mary@email.com
3  | Peter Brown    | peter@email.com
```
