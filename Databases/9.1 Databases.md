#  Introduction to Databases

##  What is a Database?

A **database** is an organised collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Rather than keeping records in paper files or scattered documents, databases allow us to store data in a structured, digital format that makes searching, editing, and analysing information efficient and reliable.

###  Why Are Databases Useful?

Databases are used in nearly every modern digital system because they allow:

-  **Centralised storage** of information
-  **Quick retrieval** of specific data
-  **Secure and controlled access** to sensitive records
-  **Efficient updates and maintenance**
-  **Data analysis and reporting**

##  What Are Databases Used For?

Databases power countless real-world systems and industries. Here are a few examples:

-  **Storing information about people** – customer profiles, user accounts, employee records
-  **Managing data about things** – inventory, products, devices, equipment
-  **Tracking events** – appointments, bookings, schedules, logs
-  **Handling complex business processes** – payroll, CRM, ERP systems
-  **Powering e-commerce platforms** – product listings, carts, order history
-  **Facilitating financial transactions** – banking, budgeting, invoicing
-  **Supporting scientific research** – experiment data, lab results, gene sequences
-  **Enabling online gaming experiences** – user stats, game state, matchmaking

##  Database Structure: Fields and Records

Databases are built using **tables**, which are made up of **records** and **fields**. Here's a breakdown:

###  Table

A **table** is a set of data elements organised in vertical columns (**fields**) and horizontal rows (**records**). Think of it like a spreadsheet.

###  Record

A **record** is a single row in a table. It contains all the information about **one entity** (e.g., one person, one product).

###  Field

A **field** is a single piece of information in a record, like a column in a table. Each field has a **data type** (e.g., text, number, date).

#### Example Table: `Students`

| ID | FirstName | LastName | DateOfBirth | Grade |
|----|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1  | Alice     | Johnson  | 2005-04-21  | A     |
| 2  | Bob       | Smith    | 2006-08-15  | B     |

- Each **row** is a record (e.g. Alice's or Bob’s data).
- Each **column** is a field (e.g. FirstName, Grade).

##  Summary

- A **database** is a digital tool for storing and managing data.
- They are **widely used** in business, research, gaming, e-commerce, and more.
- **Tables** contain **records** (rows), which consist of **fields** (columns).
- Databases make it easier to **organise, access, and analyse** large volumes of information.
