Trace tables and test data can be used to identify and correct errors.  
Your completed trace table for Activity 7.14 should look like this:  
  
<div align="center">

</div>     
  
As this algorithm only works for numbers between 0 and 100; a better algorithm could look like this:  


<div align="center">
