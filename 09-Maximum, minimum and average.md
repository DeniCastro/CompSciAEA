# Maximum, minimum and average  
  
Finding the largest and smallest values in a list are two stndard methods that are frequently found in algorithms, for example, finding the highest and lowest mark awarded to a class of students.

If the largest and smallest values are not known, an alternative method is to set the maximum and minimum values to the first item in the list.  
For example, using this method to find the highest and lowest mark awarded to a class of students.

Calculating the average (mean) of all the values in a list is an extension of the totalling method, for example, calculating the average mark for a class of students.
