# Maximum, minimum and average  
  
Finding the largest and smallest values in a list are two stndard methods that are frequently found in algorithms, for example, finding the highest and lowest mark awarded to a class of students.

MaximumMark is set to 0. This assumes that no student will have a mark lower than 0.  
MinimumMark is set to 100. This assumes that no student will score more than 100.  
We start with extreme values and update them when we find a real student mark that is higher or lower.    

```
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize
```  

This means repeat the following steps for each student in the class.
Counter starts at 1 (representing the first student) and goes up to ClassSize (total number of students).
  
  ```
IF StudentMark[Counter] > MaximumMark
    THEN
        MaximumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
 ```    
 
  📌 What does this do?  

It checks if the current student’s mark is higher than the stored MaximumMark.  
If it is, then MaximumMark is updated to that student’s mark.  
👉 Example:  
If we have these marks: [55, 78, 90, 82]  
  
Start: MaximumMark = 0  
Compare: 55 > 0 → Yes, so MaximumMark = 55  
Compare: 78 > 55 → Yes, so MaximumMark = 78  
Compare: 90 > 78 → Yes, so MaximumMark = 90  
Compare: 82 > 90 → No, so MaximumMark stays 90  
At the end, the highest mark found is 90.  
  
```
IF StudentMark[Counter] < MinimumMark
    THEN
        MinimumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
```  
📌 What does this do?

It checks if the current student’s mark is lower than MinimumMark.
If it is, then MinimumMark is updated.
👉 Example:
If the marks are [55, 78, 90, 82], starting with MinimumMark = 100:

Compare: 55 < 100 → Yes, so MinimumMark = 55
Compare: 78 < 55 → No, so MinimumMark stays 55
Compare: 90 < 55 → No
Compare: 82 < 55 → No
At the end, the lowest mark found is 55.

``NEXT Counter
``
This tells the loop to move to the next student and repeat the process.  
Key Takeaways  

- Finding the Maximum (Highest) Mark

- Start with MaximumMark = 0.
- Compare each student’s mark to MaximumMark and update it if the student’s mark is higher.
- Finding the Minimum (Lowest) Mark

- Start with MinimumMark = 100.
- Compare each student’s mark to MinimumMark and update it if the student’s mark is lower.
- Looping through all students

- The FOR loop ensures each student’s mark is checked.

- If the largest and smallest values are not known, an alternative method is to set the maximum and minimum values to the first item in the list.    

For example, using this method to find the highest and lowest mark awarded to a class of students.

# Finding Maximum and Minimum in a List (Step-by-Step Explanation)

## **Understanding the Algorithm**

This pseudocode finds the **highest (maximum) and lowest (minimum) marks** from a list of student marks.

### **Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
MaximumMark ← StudentMark[1]
MinimumMark ← StudentMark[1]  
FOR Counter ← 2 TO ClassSize
	IF StudentMark[Counter] > MaximumMark
		THEN
			MaximumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
	ENDIF
	IF StudentMark[Counter] < MinimumMark
		THEN
			MinimumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
	ENDIF
NEXT Counter
```

## **Breaking It Down**

### **Step 1: Initialize Maximum and Minimum**
```plaintext
MaximumMark ← StudentMark[1]
MinimumMark ← StudentMark[1]  
```
- The **first student's mark** is set as both the `MaximumMark` and `MinimumMark`.
- This assumes we have at least one student in the list.

📌 **Why do we start with the first student's mark?**
- Instead of setting arbitrary values like `0` or `100`, we assume the first mark is the highest and lowest.
- As we loop through the rest of the students, we will update these values accordingly.

---

### **Step 2: Loop Through the Remaining Students**
```plaintext
FOR Counter ← 2 TO ClassSize
```
- The loop starts at `2` (the second student) because we already used the first student’s mark.
- It goes up to `ClassSize` (the total number of students).

---

### **Step 3: Check for a New Maximum**
```plaintext
IF StudentMark[Counter] > MaximumMark
    THEN
        MaximumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
```
- If the current student's mark is **greater than** `MaximumMark`, we update `MaximumMark`.

👉 **Example:**
Given these marks: `[55, 78, 90, 82]`
- Start: `MaximumMark = 55`
- Compare: `78 > 55` → Yes, update `MaximumMark = 78`
- Compare: `90 > 78` → Yes, update `MaximumMark = 90`
- Compare: `82 > 90` → No change

At the end, the highest mark is **90**.

---

### **Step 4: Check for a New Minimum**
```plaintext
IF StudentMark[Counter] < MinimumMark
    THEN
        MinimumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
```
- If the current student's mark is **less than** `MinimumMark`, we update `MinimumMark`.

👉 **Example:**
Given these marks: `[55, 78, 90, 82]`
- Start: `MinimumMark = 55`
- Compare: `78 < 55` → No change
- Compare: `90 < 55` → No change
- Compare: `82 < 55` → No change

At the end, the lowest mark is **55**.

---

### **Step 5: Move to the Next Student**
```plaintext
NEXT Counter
```
- The loop continues for the next student until all students have been checked.

---

## **How to Convert This to Python**

Here’s the equivalent **Python code:**

```python
# Sample list of student marks
StudentMark = [55, 78, 90, 82]

# Initialize max and min with the first student's mark
MaximumMark = StudentMark[0]
MinimumMark = StudentMark[0]

# Loop through the remaining students
for i in range(1, len(StudentMark)):
    if StudentMark[i] > MaximumMark:
        MaximumMark = StudentMark[i]  # Update highest mark
    if StudentMark[i] < MinimumMark:
        MinimumMark = StudentMark[i]  # Update lowest mark

# Print results
print("Highest mark:", MaximumMark)
print("Lowest mark:", MinimumMark)
```

👉 **Output:**
```
Highest mark: 90
Lowest mark: 55
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Always initialize max and min with the first value in the list.**
✅ **Loop through the remaining elements and update the values when necessary.**
✅ **This method works for any list size, as long as there is at least one value.**

Calculating the average (mean) of all the values in a list is an extension of the totalling method, for example, calculating the average mark for a class of students.

## Understanding Total and Average Calculation in Pseudocode

### Algorithm Explanation
This algorithm calculates the total and average of student marks. It follows these steps:

1. **Initialize Total**: Set `Total` to 0 before starting.
2. **Loop Through Student Marks**: Use a `FOR` loop to go through each student’s mark.
3. **Add Each Mark to Total**: Keep summing up student marks.
4. **Calculate Average**: Divide the total sum by the number of students (`ClassSize`).

### Pseudocode Representation
```pseudocode
Total ← 0  // Start with zero total
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize  // Loop through each student
    Total ← Total + StudentMark[Counter]  // Add the mark to total
NEXT Counter
Average ← Total / ClassSize  // Compute the average
```

### How This Works
- **Total ← 0**: Starts with an empty sum.
- **FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize**: Loops through all student marks.
- **Total ← Total + StudentMark[Counter]**: Adds each student's mark to `Total`.
- **NEXT Counter**: Moves to the next student until all are counted.
- **Average ← Total / ClassSize**: Computes the class average.

### Python Conversion
Here’s how we implement this in Python:

```python
# List of student marks
student_marks = [78, 85, 90, 66, 72]  # Example marks
class_size = len(student_marks)  # Number of students

total = 0  # Initialize total

# Loop through each student mark
for mark in student_marks:
    total += mark  # Add each mark to total

# Calculate the average
average = total / class_size

print("Total Marks:", total)
print("Class Average:", average)
```
