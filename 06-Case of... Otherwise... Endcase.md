# CASE OF... OTHERWISE... ENDCASE  
For a **CASE** statement the value of a variable decides the path to be taken.  
Several values are usually specified. **OTHERWISE** is the path taken for all other values. The end of the statement is shown by **ENDCASE**.  

Have a look at the algorithm below that specifies what happens if the value of **Choice** is **1**, **2**, **3** or **4**.
