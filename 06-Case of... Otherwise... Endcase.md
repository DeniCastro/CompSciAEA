# CASE OF... OTHERWISE... ENDCASE  
For a **CASE** statement the value of a variable decides the path to be taken.  
Several values are usually specified. **OTHERWISE** is the path taken for all other values. The end of the statement is shown by **ENDCASE**.  

Have a look at the algorithm below that specifies what happens if the value of **Choice** is **1**, **2**, **3** or **4**.

## The pseudocode for iteration  
When some actions performed as part of an algorithm need repeating this is called iteration. Loop structures are used to perform the iteration.  
Pseudocode includes these three different types of loop structure:  

A set of number of repetitions **FOR ... TO ... NEXT**  
A repetition, where the number of repeats is not known, that is completed at least once: **REPEAT ... UNTIL**  
A repetition, where the number of repeats is not known, that may never be completed: **WHILE ... DO ... ENDWHILE***  

All types of loops can all perform the same task, for example displaying ten stars:
