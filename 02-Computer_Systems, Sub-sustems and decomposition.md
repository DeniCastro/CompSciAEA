# Computer Systems, Sub-systems, and Decomposition


A **computer system** is made up of the following components:  

- Software  
- Data  
- Hardware  
- Communications  
- People


1. **Software**  
   Software refers to the set of instructions or programs that enable hardware to perform specific tasks. It is classified into two main types:
   - **System Software**: Includes the operating system and utilities that manage hardware and basic system operations.
   - **Application Software**: Programs designed for end-users, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.

2. **Data**  
   Data represents the raw information processed by the computer system. It can include:
   - **Input Data**: Information entered into the system by users or sensors.
   - **Stored Data**: Data kept in memory or storage for future use.
   - **Output Data**: Processed information presented to the user.

3. **Hardware**  
   Hardware consists of the physical components of a computer system, such as:
   - **Input Devices**: Keyboards, mice, microphones.
   - **Processing Unit**: CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).
   - **Storage Devices**: Hard drives, SSDs, and memory.
   - **Output Devices**: Monitors, printers, speakers.

4. **Communications**  
   Communication components facilitate the exchange of data between systems or devices. Examples include:
   - **Networking Hardware**: Routers, switches, and modems.
   - **Protocols**: TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP that govern data transfer.
   - **Communication Channels**: Wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) connections.

5. **People**  
   People interact with the computer system to perform tasks or manage operations. They include:
   - **End-users**: Individuals who use applications to complete specific tasks.
   - **Developers**: Professionals who create software and systems.
   - **Administrators**: Individuals who manage and maintain the system's performance and security.


Each computer system can be divided into a set of **sub-systems**, which can further be broken down into smaller sub-systems until each sub-system performs a single action.

Computer systems vary in size, from very large to very small, and most people interact with multiple computer systems daily without realising it.  

For example:  
- When you wake up in the morning, you might use an app on your smartphone as an alarm.  
- Later, you might check the weather forecast on your computer before driving to work.  

The alarm program is an example of a small computer system. However, when you check the weather forecast, you are accessing one of the largest computer systems in the world.

## Common Types of Computer Systems

Here are five types of computer systems people commonly use:  
1. Smartphones  
2. Personal Computers  
3. Cloud Storage Services  
4. Smart Home Devices (e.g., thermostats, lights)  
5. Online Streaming Platforms  


## The Computer Systems and Its Sub-systems  

In order to understand how a computer system is built and operates, it is often divided into **sub-systems**. This division is typically represented using **top-down design**, which produces **structure diagrams** to demonstrate the modular construction of the system.  

Each sub-system can be developed by a programmer as a **sub-routine**. How each sub-routine works can be illustrated using **flowcharts** or **pseudocode**.  

**Top-down Design**  

Top-down design is the **decomposition** of a computer system into a set of **sub-systems**, then breaking each sub-system down into a set of smaller sub-systems, until each sub-system performs a single action. This is an effective way of designing a computer system to provide a solution to a problem, as each part of the problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable problems.  

The process of breaking down into smaller sub-systems is called **stepwise refinement**.  

This structured approach works for the development of both large and small computer systems. When larger computer systems are being developed, this approach allows several programmers to work independently to develop and test different sub-systems for the same system at the same time. This reduces both **development** and **testing time**.    

## Examples of Computer Systems and Sub-systems

### Smartphone System

**Sub-systems:**
- User Interface (Touchscreen interaction, gestures, etc.)
- Applications (Messaging, social media, games, etc.)
- Hardware Control (Battery management, CPU, GPU)
- Communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile data, calls)
- Security (Biometric authentication, PIN, encryption)

### E-commerce Website

**Sub-systems:**
- User Management (Login, registration, profile management)
- Product Catalogue (Browsing, searching, and filtering products)
- Shopping Cart (Adding/removing items, calculating totals)
- Payment Gateway (Processing payments securely)
- Order Management (Order tracking, status updates, returns)

---

### Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

**Sub-systems:**
- User Interface (Keypad, touchscreen, card reader)
- Account Verification (PIN validation, balance checks)
- Transaction Processing (Withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers)
- Cash Dispensing (Mechanism to count and dispense cash)
- Security (CCTV integration, encryption, fraud detection)

---

### Online Learning Platform

**Sub-systems:**
- Course Management (Adding/removing courses, organising modules)
- User Profiles (Students, teachers, admins)
- Content Delivery (Video lectures, PDFs, quizzes)
- Performance Tracking (Grades, progress dashboards)
- Communication Tools (Forums, messaging, live classes)

---

### Hospital Management System

**Sub-systems:**
- Patient Records (Registration, medical history, prescriptions)
- Appointment Scheduling (Doctors, rooms, timings)
- Billing and Payments (Insurance integration, invoice generation)
- Inventory Management (Medicines, medical equipment)
- Reporting (Medical reports, analytics, compliance reports)



### Decomposing a System  

Any problem that uses a computer system for its solution needs to be decomposed into its **component parts**. The component parts of any computer system are:  

- **Inputs**: The data used by the system that needs to be entered while the system is active.  
- **Processes**: The tasks that need to be performed using the input data and any other previously stored data.  
- **Outputs**: Information that needs to be displayed or printed for the users of the system.  
- **Storage**: Data that needs to be stored in files on an appropriate medium for use in the future.
