# Computer Systems, Sub-systems, and Decomposition

A **computer system** is made up of:  
- Software  
- Data  
- Hardware  
- Communications  
- People  

Each computer system can be divided into a set of **sub-systems**, which can further be broken down into smaller sub-systems until each sub-system performs a single action.

Computer systems vary in size, from very large to very small, and most people interact with multiple computer systems daily without realising it.  

For example:  
- When you wake up in the morning, you might use an app on your smartphone as an alarm.  
- Later, you might check the weather forecast on your computer before driving to work.  

The alarm program is an example of a small computer system. However, when you check the weather forecast, you are accessing one of the largest computer systems in the world.

## Common Types of Computer Systems

Here are five types of computer systems people commonly use:  
1. Smartphones  
2. Personal Computers  
3. Cloud Storage Services  
4. Smart Home Devices (e.g., thermostats, lights)  
5. Online Streaming Platforms  


# The Computer Systems and Its Sub-systems

## (Title) The Computer Systems and Its Sub-systems  

In order to understand how a computer system is built and operates, it is often divided into **sub-systems**. This division is typically represented using **top-down design**, which produces **structure diagrams** to demonstrate the modular construction of the system.  

Each sub-system can be developed by a programmer as a **sub-routine**. How each sub-routine works can be illustrated using **flowcharts** or **pseudocode**.
