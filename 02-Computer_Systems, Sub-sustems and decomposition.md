# Computer Systems, Sub-systems, and Decomposition

A **computer system** is made up of:  
- Software  
- Data  
- Hardware  
- Communications  
- People  

Each computer system can be divided into a set of **sub-systems**, which can further be broken down into smaller sub-systems until each sub-system performs a single action.

Computer systems vary in size, from very large to very small, and most people interact with multiple computer systems daily without realising it.  

For example:  
- When you wake up in the morning, you might use an app on your smartphone as an alarm.  
- Later, you might check the weather forecast on your computer before driving to work.  

The alarm program is an example of a small computer system. However, when you check the weather forecast, you are accessing one of the largest computer systems in the world.

## Common Types of Computer Systems

Here are five types of computer systems people commonly use:  
1. Smartphones  
2. Personal Computers  
3. Cloud Storage Services  
4. Smart Home Devices (e.g., thermostats, lights)  
5. Online Streaming Platforms  


## The Computer Systems and Its Sub-systems  

In order to understand how a computer system is built and operates, it is often divided into **sub-systems**. This division is typically represented using **top-down design**, which produces **structure diagrams** to demonstrate the modular construction of the system.  

Each sub-system can be developed by a programmer as a **sub-routine**. How each sub-routine works can be illustrated using **flowcharts** or **pseudocode**.  

**Top-down Design**  

Top-down design is the **decomposition** of a computer system into a set of **sub-systems**, then breaking each sub-system down into a set of smaller sub-systems, until each sub-system performs a single action. This is an effective way of designing a computer system to provide a solution to a problem, as each part of the problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable problems.  

The process of breaking down into smaller sub-systems is called **stepwise refinement**.  

This structured approach works for the development of both large and small computer systems. When larger computer systems are being developed, this approach allows several programmers to work independently to develop and test different sub-systems for the same system at the same time. This reduces both **development** and **testing time**.  


### Decomposing a System  

Any problem that uses a computer system for its solution needs to be decomposed into its **component parts**. The component parts of any computer system are:  

- **Inputs**: The data used by the system that needs to be entered while the system is active.  
- **Processes**: The tasks that need to be performed using the input data and any other previously stored data.  
- **Outputs**: Information that needs to be displayed or printed for the users of the system.  
- **Storage**: Data that needs to be stored in files on an appropriate medium for use in the future.
