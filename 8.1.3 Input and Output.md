# Introduction
In order to be able to enter data and output results, programs need to use input and output statements. For IGCSE Computer Science, you need to be able to write algorithms and programs that take input from a keyboard and output to a screen. 

For a program to be useful, the user needs to know what they are expected to input, so each input needs to be accompanied by a prompt stating the input required.

Here are examples of inputs in programming code - pseudocode was considered before. Now look at the same codes in Python.

In a programming language, the data type of the input must match the required data type of the variable where the input data is to be stored. All inputs default as strings, so if the input should be an integer or real number, commands are also used to change the data type of the input (for instance, in Python these are `int()` or `float()`).

## Input Statements
```python
radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of the cylinder: "))
```

# Input and Output Exercises

## Introduction

Understanding how to use input and output in Python is essential for developing interactive programs. In this set of exercises, you will work with longer code snippets that involve user input, calculations, and formatted output. The goal is to copy the code, run it, analyze the output, and determine what it displays.

## Exercise 1: Simple Arithmetic Operations

```python
# Request user input for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
diff_result = num1 - num2
prod_result = num1 * num2
div_result = num1 / num2

# Display results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", diff_result)
print("Product:", prod_result)
print("Quotient:", div_result)
```

### Task:
- Copy and run the code.
- Provide the expected output if the user enters `8` and `2`.
- Identify how different inputs affect the results.

## Exercise 2: Calculating the Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle

```python
# Request user input for length and width
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate area and perimeter
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Display results
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
print("Perimeter of the rectangle:", perimeter)
```

### Task:
- Run the code and test with different values.
- If `length = 5` and `width = 3`, what is the expected output?

---

## Exercise 3: Temperature Conversion

```python
# Request user input for temperature in Celsius
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Convert to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Display result
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)
```

### Task:
- Run the program with `celsius = 25`. What does the output look like?
- Modify the program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

---

## Exercise 4: Swapping Two Numbers

```python
# Request user input for two numbers
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Swap values
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

# Display swapped values
print("After swapping:")
print("First number:", a)
print("Second number:", b)
```

### Task:
- Run the program with `a = 10` and `b = 20`. What is the output?
- Explain why swapping works in this method.

## Exercise 5: Understanding and Commenting Python Code

### Instructions
Below is a Python script that performs several tasks. However, the description of what each part does is out of order. 
Your task is to carefully examine the code, understand its functionality, and add appropriate comments explaining what is happening in each section.

Here are the descriptions (out of order) of what the code does:
1. The user is asked to input their name.
2. The program calculates the square and cube of a given number.
3. A greeting message is displayed using the user's name.
4. The program calculates the area of a rectangle given width and height.
5. A summary of all results is printed at the end.

Now, copy the following code into your Python editor and add comments explaining each part correctly.

```python
# Python script for commenting exercise

def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to the program.")
    
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    square = number ** 2
    cube = number ** 3
    
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the rectangle: "))
    area = width * height
    
    print("\nSummary of calculations:")
    print("Your number:", number)
    print("Square of the number:", square)
    print("Cube of the number:", cube)
    print("Rectangle width:", width, "Height:", height)
    print("Rectangle area:", area)
    
main()
```

## Answer Key
Here is the correctly commented version of the code:

```python
# Python script for commenting exercise

def main():
    # Asking for user input (name)
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    # Displaying a greeting message with the user's name
    print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to the program.")
    
    # Asking for a number and storing it as a float
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    # Calculating the square of the number
    square = number ** 2
    # Calculating the cube of the number
    cube = number ** 3
    
    # Asking for rectangle dimensions
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of the rectangle: "))
    # Calculating the area of the rectangle
    area = width * height
    
    # Printing the results in a summary format
    print("\nSummary of calculations:")
    print("Your number:", number)
    print("Square of the number:", square)
    print("Cube of the number:", cube)
    print("Rectangle width:", width, "Height:", height)
    print("Rectangle area:", area)
    
main()
```
