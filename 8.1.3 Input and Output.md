# Introduction
In order to be able to enter data and output results, programs need to use input and output statements. For IGCSE Computer Science, you need to be able to write algorithms and programs that take input from a keyboard and output to a screen. 

For a program to be useful, the user needs to know what they are expected to input, so each input needs to be accompanied by a prompt stating the input required.

Here are examples of inputs in programming code - pseudocode was considered before. Now look at the same codes in Python.

In a programming language, the data type of the input must match the required data type of the variable where the input data is to be stored. All inputs default as strings, so if the input should be an integer or real number, commands are also used to change the data type of the input (for instance, in Python these are `int()` or `float()`).

## Input Statements
```python
radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of the cylinder: "))
```

## Language
Python combines the prompt with the input statement.  

# Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic Output
# Copy the code below and run it. What is the expected output?

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
diff_result = num1 - num2
prod_result = num1 * num2
quot_result = num1 / num2

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", diff_result)
print("Product:", prod_result)
print("Quotient:", quot_result)

# What values did you enter? What results were displayed?

# ----------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 2: Calculating a Discount
# Read the code carefully and determine what it will display.

price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))
discount = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

discount_amount = (discount / 100) * price
final_price = price - discount_amount

print("Discount amount:", discount_amount)
print("Final price after discount:", final_price)

# After running the code, write down your observations.

# ----------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 3: Temperature Conversion
# Predict what the output will be before running the code.

celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
kelvin = celsius + 273.15

print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)
print("Temperature in Kelvin:", kelvin)

# Compare the displayed results with your predictions.

# ----------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 4: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
# What does this code do? Write the expected output before running it.

length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width: "))

area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
print("Perimeter of the rectangle:", perimeter)

# Were the results what you expected?

# ----------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 5: Simple Interest Calculation
# Read the code and describe what each part does before running it.

principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))

interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
total_amount = principal + interest

print("Interest earned:", interest)
print("Total amount after interest:", total_amount)

# Write down the displayed output after execution.
