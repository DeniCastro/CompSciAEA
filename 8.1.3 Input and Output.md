# Introduction
In order to be able to enter data and output results, programs need to use input and output statements. For IGCSE Computer Science, you need to be able to write algorithms and programs that take input from a keyboard and output to a screen. 

For a program to be useful, the user needs to know what they are expected to input, so each input needs to be accompanied by a prompt stating the input required.

Here are examples of inputs in programming code - pseudocode was considered before. Now look at the same codes in Python.

In a programming language, the data type of the input must match the required data type of the variable where the input data is to be stored. All inputs default as strings, so if the input should be an integer or real number, commands are also used to change the data type of the input (for instance, in Python these are `int()` or `float()`).

## Input Statements
```python
radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of the cylinder: "))
```

## Language
Python combines the prompt with the input statement.
