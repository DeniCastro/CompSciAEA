# 8.1.5 Use of nested statements  
Selection and iteration statements can be nested one inside the other. This powerful method reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes it simpler for a programmer to test their programs.  
One type of construct can be nested within another - for example, selection can be nested within a condition-controlled loop, or one loop can be nested within another loop.  
  
For example, the following pseudocode algorithm uses nested loops to provide a solution for the problem set out here:  

- calculate and output highest, lowest, and average marks awarded for a class of twenty students.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each student.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each of the six subjects studied by the student, each subject has five tests.
- assume that all marks input are whole numbers between 0 and 100.

## Activity 8.11  
In Python, use the pseudocode solution to help you to write and test a short program to calculate and output largest, highest, lowest and average marks for a single subject with five tests taken by a student.  
Hints:  
- Look at the other statements and output needed as well as the loop.
- For testing purposes, you can reduce the number of tests to two or three.

  
Now look at the middle loop that surrounds the inner loop for the number of students.  
  
## Activity 8.12  
When the single subject program is working, extend it to calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for a single student with six subjects studied by a student.  
Hints:  
- Look at the other statements and outputs needed as well as the loop.
- For testing purposes reduce the number of subjects to two or three.

Finally look at the whole program that includes the outer loop for the whole class.  

## Activity 8.13  
When the single student program is working, extend your program to complete the task to calculate and output the largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for the whole class of 20 students.  

Hint:  
- For testing purposes reduce the cass size to two or three.
