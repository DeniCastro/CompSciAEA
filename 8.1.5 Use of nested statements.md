# 8.1.5 Use of nested statements  
Selection and iteration statements can be nested one inside the other. This powerful method reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes it simpler for a programmer to test their programs.  
One type of construct can be nested within another - for example, selection can be nested within a condition-controlled loop, or one loop can be nested within another loop.  
  
For example, the following pseudocode algorithm uses nested loops to provide a solution for the problem set out here:  

- calculate and output highest, lowest, and average marks awarded for a class of twenty students.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each student.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each of the six subjects studied by the student, each subject has five tests.
- assume that all marks input are whole numbers between 0 and 100.

## Activity 8.11  
In Python, use the pseudocode solution to help you to write and test a short program to calculate and output largest, highest, lowest and average marks for a single subject with five tests taken by a student.  
Hints:  
- Look at the other statements and output needed as well as the loop.
- For testing purposes, you can reduce the number of tests to two or three.

Use the following source comments to establish your code:  

```python
# Get Number of Students
# Outer loop - runs once for each student
# add the three needed variables (total, highest and lowest)   
# Inner loop - Creates the test loop, gets the marks and uptates the total
# Check highest and lowest
# Checks average
# output results for this student

```
  
Now look at the middle loop that surrounds the inner loop for the number of students.  
  
## Activity 8.12  
Extend the program to calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for a single student with six subjects studied by a student.  
Hints:  
- Look at the other statements and outputs needed as well as the loop.
- For testing purposes reduce the number of subjects to two or three.

Finally look at the whole program that includes the outer loop for the whole class.  

````python
# Get Number of Students
student_num = int(input("Enter number of students: "))

# Outer loop - runs once for each student
for student in range(1, student_num + 1):
    print(f"\nEntering values for student {student}")

    # add the three needed variables (total, highest and lowest)
    total = 0
    highest = -1
    lowest = 101

    # Inner loop - Creates the test loop, gets the marks and updates the total
    for test in range(1, 6):
        mark = float(input(f"Enter the mark for test {test}: "))
        total += mark

# Check highest and lowest
        if mark > highest:
            highest = mark
        if mark < lowest:
            lowest = mark

# Checks average
    average = total / 5

# output results for this student
    print(f"\nShowing results for student {student}:")
    print(f"Highest mark: {highest}")
    print(f"Lowest mark: {lowest}.")
    print(f"Average mark: {average:.2f}.")

````

## Activity 8.13  
When the single student program is working, extend your program to complete the task to calculate and output the largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for the whole class of 20 students.  

Hint:  
- For testing purposes reduce the cass size to two or three.
