# 8.1.5 Use of nested statements  
Selection and iteration statements can be nested one inside the other. This powerful method reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes it simpler for a programmer to test their programs.  
One type of construct can be nested within another - for example, selection can be nested within a condition-controlled loop, or one loop can be nested within another loop.  
  
For example, the following pseudocode algorithm uses nested loops to provide a solution for the problem set out here:  

- calculate and output highest, lowest, and average marks awarded for a class of twenty students.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each student.
- calculate and output largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for each of the six subjects studied by the student, each subject has five tests.
- assume that all marks input are whole numbers between 0 and 100.
