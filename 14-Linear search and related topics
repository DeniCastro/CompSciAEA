# Sorting in Computer Science  
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a meaningful order, such as alphabetical order or numerical sequence. This makes searching and data management more efficient. There are many sorting methods, but in IGCSE Computer Science, **Bubble Sort** is a key focus.  

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This continues until the entire list is sorted.

# Linear Search: A Simple Search Method  
A **linear search** is a method of finding a specific item in a list by checking each element one by one from start to finish. It does not require the list to be sorted and works well for small datasets. The search stops when the item is found or when the whole list has been checked.  

An example of a linear search in real life is **looking for a contact in an unordered phone list**. Since the contacts are not sorted, the only way to find a specific name is by checking one at a time.

# The Purpose of Searching  
**Searching in computer science** is used to determine if a specific value exists within a dataset. It does not sort, store, or delete values; it simply helps locate data efficiently.

# Stopping Conditions in Linear Search  
A linear search stops in two scenarios:  
1. **When it finds the target value.**  
2. **When it has checked all elements and confirmed that the value is not present.**  

Unlike some search methods, a linear search does not stop at a fixed number of steps—it continues until it reaches one of these two stopping points.

# Validation in Computer Systems  
**Validation** is the process of checking whether input data is reasonable before accepting it. It does not confirm accuracy but ensures that the data follows expected rules.  

For example, an age input should not contain letters, and an email field must include "@" to be considered valid.  

Validation techniques include:  
- **Length check** – Ensuring data has the correct number of characters.  
- **Type check** – Confirming that data is in the correct format (e.g., a phone number should contain only digits).  
- **Presence check** – Ensuring that a required field is not left blank.  

However, there is no **"copy check"** in standard validation methods.

# Verification: Ensuring Data Accuracy  
**Verification** ensures that data entered into a system is correct and matches the intended input. Unlike validation, which only checks if the data is reasonable, verification confirms accuracy using methods like:  
- **Double entry** – Typing the same data twice to ensure they match.  
- **Proofreading** – Manually checking the data for errors.

# The Role of a Check Digit  
A **check digit** is an extra number added to codes, such as barcodes or account numbers, to help detect errors. It does not fix mistakes but helps identify typing errors or incorrect entries.

# Test Data in Programming  
**Test data** is used during programming to ensure that a program works correctly. Developers use different types of test data, including normal, extreme, and invalid inputs, to check how the program responds under various conditions. This helps detect and fix bugs before the program is used by real users.

# How Bubble Sort Works  
**Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.  

Although easy to understand, Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets compared to more advanced sorting methods.
