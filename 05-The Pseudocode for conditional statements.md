# The Pseudocode for conditional statements
When different actions are performed by an algorithm according to the values of the variables, conditional statements can be used to decide which action should be taken.

There are two types of conditional statement:

</div> 

## IF... THEN... ELSE... ENDIF  

For an **IF** condition the **THEN** path is followed if the condition is true and **ELSE** path is followed if the condition is false. There may or may not be an **ELSE** path is followed if the condition is false. There may or may not be an **ELSE** path. The end of the statement is shown by **ENDIF**.  

There are different ways that an **IF** condition can be set up:

Have a look at the algorithm below that checks if a percentage mark is valid and whether it is a pass or a fail. This makes use of two IF statements; the second **IF** statement is part of the first **ELSE** path. This is called a **nestled IF**.

### Activity 7.4
Rewrite the algorithm to check for a mark between 0 and 20 and a pass mark of 10 on the link below.
