# 7.4.4 Linear Search  

A search is used to check if a value is stored in a list, performed systematically working through the items in the list. There are several standaard search methods, but you only need to understand one method for IGCSE Computer Science. This is called a **linear search**, which inspects each item in a list in turn to see if the item matches the value searched for.  
For example, searching for a name in a class list of student names, where all the names stored are different:
