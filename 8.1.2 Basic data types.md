# **Understanding Data Types in Programming**

## **Introduction**
Data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. Different programming languages handle data types differently. Some languages require explicit type declarations, while others determine types based on assigned values.

Python is dynamically typed, meaning it does not require explicit declarations. However, in structured pseudocode, data types are often explicitly stated.

## **Common Data Types**
Below are the most commonly used data types in programming:

1. **Integer**: Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
2. **Real (Float in Python)**: Numbers with decimals.
3. **Character (Char)**: A single letter, digit, or symbol.
4. **String**: A sequence of characters.
5. **Boolean**: True or False values used for logic-based operations.

## **Comparison of Data Types in Pseudocode and Python**
The following table compares how data types are declared and used in **pseudocode** and **Python**:

| **Data Type**  | **Pseudocode Declaration**            | **Python Declaration**         |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Integer**  | `DECLARE age : INTEGER`       | `age = 25`                 |
| **Real (Float)** | `DECLARE price : REAL`      | `price = 19.99`             |
| **Character** | `DECLARE grade : CHAR`       | `grade = 'A'`               |
| **String**   | `DECLARE name : STRING`       | `name = "Alice"`            |
| **Boolean**  | `DECLARE isStudent : BOOLEAN` | `is_student = True`         |

## **Key Differences Between Pseudocode and Python**
- **Pseudocode requires explicit declarations**, whereas Python determines the type from the assigned value.
- **Python uses `float` instead of `REAL`** for decimal numbers.
- **Character data (`CHAR`) in pseudocode is a single letter**, but Python does not differentiate between `char` and `string` (both are represented as `str`).
- **Boolean values in Python use `True` and `False`** instead of `BOOLEAN` from pseudocode.

# Data Types Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises to practice data types in Python. These exercises are designed for beginners and can be executed in any Python compiler.

---

## **Data types - coding in practice**

### **1. String Concatenation**
Form a word using `+` and the following strings:

```python
part1 = "Pro"
part2 = "gram"
part3 = "ming"
```

Write a line of code that joins these strings to form a single word and displays it.

---

### **2. Identifying Data Type Errors**  
What is the problem in the following line of code?  

```python
age = "25" + 5
```

Explain the error and correct it.

---

### **3. Working with Boolean Values**  
What will be the output of the following code?  

```python
is_student = True
is_teacher = False
print(is_student and is_teacher)
print(is_student or is_teacher)
```

Write down your expected answers before running the code.

---

### **4. Type Conversion Challenge**  
Convert the following values into integers:

```python
num1 = "42"
num2 = 18.9
```

Store the converted values in `int_num1` and `int_num2`.

---

### **5. Character Extraction from a String**  
Extract the first and last characters from the following string:

```python
word = "Python"
```

Store the first character in `first_char` and the last character in `last_char`.

---

### **6. Mixing Data Types**  
What happens when you run the following code?  

```python
num = 10
text = "Apples"
result = num + text
print(result)
```

Explain the error and fix it.

---

### **7. Checking Data Types**  
Write a Python program that prints the type of each of the following variables:

```python
a = 10
b = 3.14
c = "Hello"
d = True
```

---

### **8. Swapping Variables**  
Swap the values of `x` and `y` without using a third variable.

```python
x = 5
y = 10
```

---

### **9. Working with Lists and Data Types**  
Identify the data types of each element in the following list:

```python
my_list = [12, "Python", 3.14, False]
```

Use a loop to print the type of each element.

---

### **10. User Input and Type Casting**  
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their age and then prints it as an integer.

```python
# Prompt the user for their age
```

Make sure to convert the input to an integer before printing it.

---

## **Show the work on your notebooks**

1. Copy and paste the Python code into your compiler.
2. Solve the exercises by writing the correct code.
3. Run the program to check if your answers are correct.
4. Compare your results with the expected output.
