# **Understanding Data Types in Programming**

## **Introduction**
Data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. Different programming languages handle data types differently. Some languages require explicit type declarations, while others determine types based on assigned values.

Python is dynamically typed, meaning it does not require explicit declarations. However, in structured pseudocode, data types are often explicitly stated.

## **Common Data Types**
Below are the most commonly used data types in programming:

1. **Integer**: Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
2. **Real (Float in Python)**: Numbers with decimals.
3. **Character (Char)**: A single letter, digit, or symbol.
4. **String**: A sequence of characters.
5. **Boolean**: True or False values used for logic-based operations.

## **Comparison of Data Types in Pseudocode and Python**
The following table compares how data types are declared and used in **pseudocode** and **Python**:

| **Data Type**  | **Pseudocode Declaration**            | **Python Declaration**         |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Integer**  | `DECLARE age : INTEGER`       | `age = 25`                 |
| **Real (Float)** | `DECLARE price : REAL`      | `price = 19.99`             |
| **Character** | `DECLARE grade : CHAR`       | `grade = 'A'`               |
| **String**   | `DECLARE name : STRING`       | `name = "Alice"`            |
| **Boolean**  | `DECLARE isStudent : BOOLEAN` | `is_student = True`         |

## **Key Differences Between Pseudocode and Python**
- **Pseudocode requires explicit declarations**, whereas Python determines the type from the assigned value.
- **Python uses `float` instead of `REAL`** for decimal numbers.
- **Character data (`CHAR`) in pseudocode is a single letter**, but Python does not differentiate between `char` and `string` (both are represented as `str`).
- **Boolean values in Python use `True` and `False`** instead of `BOOLEAN` from pseudocode.
