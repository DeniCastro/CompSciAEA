# Sorting in Computer Science  

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a meaningful order, such as alphabetical order or numerical sequence. This makes searching and data management more efficient. There are many sorting methods, but in IGCSE Computer Science, **Bubble Sort** is a key focus.  

| **Concept**       | **Explanation** |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Definition**    | Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order (e.g., alphabetical or numerical). |
| **Purpose**      | Makes searching and data management more efficient. |
| **Types of Sorting** | Various methods exist, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. |
| **Bubble Sort**   | A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. |
| **How It Works**  | Steps through the list multiple times, moving larger elements towards the end until the entire list is sorted. |
| **Efficiency**    | Easy to understand but inefficient for large datasets due to its slow speed. |
| **Best Use Case** | Suitable for small datasets where simplicity is more important than speed. |
