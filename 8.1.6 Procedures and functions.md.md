# 8.1.6 Procedures and functions  
When writing an algorithm, there are often similar tasks to perform that make use of the same groups of statements. Instead of repeating these statmenets and writing new code every time they are required, many programming languages make use of subroutines, also known as named *procedures* or *functions*. These are defined once and can be called many times within a program.  

## Procedures, functions and parameters  
A **procedure** is a set of programming statements grouped together under a single name that can be called to perform a task at any point in a program. In contrast to a procedure, a function will return a value back to the main program.  
**Parameters** are the variables that store the values of the arguments passed to a procedure or function. Some but not all procedures and functions will have parameters.  

## Definitions and use of procedures and functions, with or without parameters  
Procedures without parameters.  
Here is an example of a procedure without parameters in pseudocode:  
  
```  
PROCEDURE Stars  
  OUTPUT"**********"  
ENDPROCEDURE  
```  

**The procedure can then be called in the main part of the program as many times as is required in the following day:**  
```python  
CALL Stars  
```  
Instead of calling them procedures, different terminology is used by each programming language. Procedures are known as:    
  
- void functions in Python  
- subroutines in VB  
- methods in Java  
    
**Procedure Stars in python**
```python  
  def Stars():
    print("**********")  
```  
**Call**  
```python  
Stars()
```
