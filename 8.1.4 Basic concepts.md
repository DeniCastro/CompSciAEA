# 8.1.4 Basic concepts  

### When writing the steps required to solve a problem, the following concepts need to be used and understood.
  
- (a) Sequence  
- (b) selection  
- (c) iteration  
- (d) counting and totalling  
- (e) string handling  
- (f) use of operators  

## 8.1.4(a) Sequence  
Sequence is one of the fundamental concepts in programming. It refers to the order in which instructions are executed in a program. In a sequential program, each statement runs in the exact order they appear, from top to bottom, unless explicitly altered by control structures such as loops or conditional statements.

Understanding sequence is essential because computers follow instructions literally, executing them line by line. If the order is incorrect, the program may not function as expected.

## Key Points
- A program follows a **top-to-bottom execution flow**.
- The **order of instructions matters** to achieve the desired outcome.
- Sequence ensures that **operations happen in a logical progression**.
- It is the **foundation for more advanced control structures** such as selection and iteration.

## Example in Pseudocode
Below is an example of a sequential algorithm to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```plaintext
BEGIN
    DECLARE length, width, area AS REAL
    OUTPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle:"
    INPUT length
    OUTPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle:"
    INPUT width
    area ‚Üê length * width
    OUTPUT "The area of the rectangle is: ", area
END
```

## Example in Python
The equivalent Python code follows the same sequential execution:

```python
# Request user input
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = length * width

# Display result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
```

### Explanation:
1. The program starts by **asking for user input**.
2. It **stores the input values** in `length` and `width`.
3. It then **calculates the area** by multiplying length and width.
4. Finally, the **output is displayed** in a structured manner.

- Sequence ensures instructions are executed **in order**.
- Each step must **follow logically from the previous one**.
- **Mistakes in sequence** can cause incorrect results or program crashes.
  

## Common Mistakes in Sequence
- **Reordering instructions incorrectly:** If the area is calculated before getting user input, it will produce an error.
- **Skipping steps:** Missing a required input step will make the program incomplete.
- **Forgetting to store values:** Variables must hold the input before they can be used in calculations.
