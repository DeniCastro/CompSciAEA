# 8.1.4 Basic concepts  

### When writing the steps required to solve a problem, the following concepts need to be used and understood.
  
- (a) Sequence  
- (b) selection  
- (c) iteration  
- (d) counting and totalling  
- (e) string handling  
- (f) use of operators  

## 8.1.4(a) Sequence  
Sequence is one of the fundamental concepts in programming. It refers to the order in which instructions are executed in a program. In a sequential program, each statement runs in the exact order they appear, from top to bottom, unless explicitly altered by control structures such as loops or conditional statements.

Understanding sequence is essential because computers follow instructions literally, executing them line by line. If the order is incorrect, the program may not function as expected.

## Key Points
- A program follows a **top-to-bottom execution flow**.
- The **order of instructions matters** to achieve the desired outcome.
- Sequence ensures that **operations happen in a logical progression**.
- It is the **foundation for more advanced control structures** such as selection and iteration.

## Example in Pseudocode
Below is an example of a sequential algorithm to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```plaintext
BEGIN
    DECLARE length, width, area AS REAL
    OUTPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle:"
    INPUT length
    OUTPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle:"
    INPUT width
    area ← length * width
    OUTPUT "The area of the rectangle is: ", area
END
```

## Example in Python
The equivalent Python code follows the same sequential execution:

```python
# Request user input
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = length * width

# Display result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
```

### Explanation:
1. The program starts by **asking for user input**.
2. It **stores the input values** in `length` and `width`.
3. It then **calculates the area** by multiplying length and width.
4. Finally, the **output is displayed** in a structured manner.

- Sequence ensures instructions are executed **in order**.
- Each step must **follow logically from the previous one**.
- **Mistakes in sequence** can cause incorrect results or program crashes.
  

## Common Mistakes in Sequence
- **Reordering instructions incorrectly:** If the area is calculated before getting user input, it will produce an error.
- **Skipping steps:** Missing a required input step will make the program incomplete.
- **Forgetting to store values:** Variables must hold the input before they can be used in calculations.
  
## 8.1.4(b) Selection  
Selection is a very useful technique, allowing different routes through the steps of a program. For example, data items can be picked out according to given criteria, such as: selecting the largest value or smallest value, selecting items over a certain price, selecting everyone who is male.
Selection was demonstrated in pseudocode with the use of IF and CASE statements in the previous module.    

Selection is a fundamental concept in programming that allows a program to make decisions based on conditions. Instead of following a single path, selection enables different routes through the program based on given criteria.

For example, selection can be used to:
- Choose the largest or smallest value
- Filter items based on a condition (e.g., price above a certain value)
- Perform actions based on user input

In Python, selection is implemented using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

## **Using `if` Statements**
An `if` statement runs a block of code only if a specified condition is `True`.

### **Example 1: Checking if a Number is Positive**
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
```
💡 **Explanation:** If the user enters a number greater than 0, the program will print "The number is positive." If not, nothing happens.

---

## **Using `if-else` Statements**
If a condition in an `if` statement is `False`, the `else` block executes.

### **Example 2: Checking if a Number is Even or Odd**
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```
 **Explanation:** The program checks if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints "even"; otherwise, it prints "odd."

---

## **Using `if-elif-else` Statements**
When there are multiple conditions to check, we use `elif` (short for "else if").

### **Example 3: Grading System**
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```
 **Explanation:** The program assigns a grade based on the score range.

---

## **Using `match-case` (Python 3.10+)**
The `match` statement (similar to `switch` in other languages) provides a clear way to handle multiple cases.

### **Example 4: Simple Menu System**
```python
choice = input("Enter a fruit (apple/orange/banana): ")
match choice:
    case "apple":
        print("You chose an apple!")
    case "orange":
        print("You chose an orange!")
    case "banana":
        print("You chose a banana!")
    case _:
        print("Invalid choice.")
```
 **Explanation:** The program checks the user’s input and prints a message accordingly.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ `if` checks a condition and executes a block of code if `True`.
✅ `else` runs if the `if` condition is `False`.
✅ `elif` allows checking multiple conditions.
✅ `match-case` (Python 3.10+) is useful for handling multiple predefined values.
