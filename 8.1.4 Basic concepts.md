# 8.1.4 Basic concepts  

### When writing the steps required to solve a problem, the following concepts need to be used and understood.
  
- (a) Sequence  
- (b) selection  
- (c) iteration  
- (d) counting and totalling  
- (e) string handling  
- (f) use of operators  

## 8.1.4(a) Sequence  
Sequence is one of the fundamental concepts in programming. It refers to the order in which instructions are executed in a program. In a sequential program, each statement runs in the exact order they appear, from top to bottom, unless explicitly altered by control structures such as loops or conditional statements.

Understanding sequence is essential because computers follow instructions literally, executing them line by line. If the order is incorrect, the program may not function as expected.

## Key Points
- A program follows a **top-to-bottom execution flow**.
- The **order of instructions matters** to achieve the desired outcome.
- Sequence ensures that **operations happen in a logical progression**.
- It is the **foundation for more advanced control structures** such as selection and iteration.

## Example in Pseudocode
Below is an example of a sequential algorithm to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```plaintext
BEGIN
    DECLARE length, width, area AS REAL
    OUTPUT "Enter the length of the rectangle:"
    INPUT length
    OUTPUT "Enter the width of the rectangle:"
    INPUT width
    area ← length * width
    OUTPUT "The area of the rectangle is: ", area
END
```

## Example in Python
The equivalent Python code follows the same sequential execution:

```python
# Request user input
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = length * width

# Display result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
```

### Explanation:
1. The program starts by **asking for user input**.
2. It **stores the input values** in `length` and `width`.
3. It then **calculates the area** by multiplying length and width.
4. Finally, the **output is displayed** in a structured manner.

- Sequence ensures instructions are executed **in order**.
- Each step must **follow logically from the previous one**.
- **Mistakes in sequence** can cause incorrect results or program crashes.
  

## Common Mistakes in Sequence
- **Reordering instructions incorrectly:** If the area is calculated before getting user input, it will produce an error.
- **Skipping steps:** Missing a required input step will make the program incomplete.
- **Forgetting to store values:** Variables must hold the input before they can be used in calculations.
  
## 8.1.4(b) Selection  
Selection is a very useful technique, allowing different routes through the steps of a program. For example, data items can be picked out according to given criteria, such as: selecting the largest value or smallest value, selecting items over a certain price, selecting everyone who is male.
Selection was demonstrated in pseudocode with the use of IF and CASE statements in the previous module.    

Selection is a fundamental concept in programming that allows a program to make decisions based on conditions. Instead of following a single path, selection enables different routes through the program based on given criteria.

For example, selection can be used to:
- Choose the largest or smallest value
- Filter items based on a condition (e.g., price above a certain value)
- Perform actions based on user input

In Python, selection is implemented using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

---

## **Using `if` Statements**
An `if` statement runs a block of code only if a specified condition is `True`.

### **Example 1: Checking if a Number is Positive**
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
```
**Explanation:** If the user enters a number greater than 0, the program will print "The number is positive." If not, nothing happens.

---

## **Using `if-else` Statements**
If a condition in an `if` statement is `False`, the `else` block executes.

### **Example 2: Checking if a Number is Even or Odd**
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```
 **Explanation:** The program checks if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints "even"; otherwise, it prints "odd."

---

## **Using `if-elif-else` Statements**
When there are multiple conditions to check, we use `elif` (short for "else if").

### **Example 3: Grading System**
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```
 **Explanation:** The program assigns a grade based on the score range.

---

## **Using `match-case` (Python 3.10+)**
The `match` statement (similar to `switch` in other languages) provides a clear way to handle multiple cases.

### **Example 4: Simple Menu System**
```python
choice = input("Enter a fruit (apple/orange/banana): ")
match choice:
    case "apple":
        print("You chose an apple!")
    case "orange":
        print("You chose an orange!")
    case "banana":
        print("You chose a banana!")
    case _:
        print("Invalid choice.")
```
 **Explanation:** The program checks the user’s input and prints a message accordingly.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ `if` checks a condition and executes a block of code if `True`.
✅ `else` runs if the `if` condition is `False`.
✅ `elif` allows checking multiple conditions.
✅ `match-case` (Python 3.10+) is useful for handling multiple predefined values.  


### How does selection work in Python?

Selection is a fundamental concept in programming that allows a program to make decisions and follow different execution paths based on conditions. In Python, selection is mainly implemented using **if statements** and **match-case statements**.

Selection allows a program to:
- Check conditions and execute specific blocks of code
- Compare values and perform different actions based on user input
- Make decisions based on predefined criteria

---

## IF Statements
Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control decision-making. 

### Basic Structure:
```python
if condition:
    # Code executes if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code executes if the first condition is False but this one is True
else:
    # Code executes if all previous conditions are False
```

### Example 1: Checking Age for Voting Eligibility
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print("You are not old enough to vote.")
```

### Example 2: Finding the Largest of Two Numbers
```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if num1 > num2:
    print("The first number is larger.")
elif num2 > num1:
    print("The second number is larger.")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal.")
```

---

## Match-Case Statements (Python 3.10+)
The `match-case` statement is used for checking multiple conditions, similar to `switch-case` in other languages.

### Example: Categorizing Numbers
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 3: "))

match number:
    case 1:
        print("You selected One.")
    case 2:
        print("You selected Two.")
    case 3:
        print("You selected Three.")
    case _:
        print("Invalid choice!")
```

### Exercises 8.1.4(b)  

### Exercise 1: Odd or Even
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number. The program should check whether the number is odd or even and display the result.

### Exercise 2: Grading System
Write a Python program that asks for a student's score and categorizes it based on the following:
- 90 and above: A
- 80 to 89: B
- 70 to 79: C
- 60 to 69: D
- Below 60: F

### Exercise 3: Temperature Converter
Ask the user to input a temperature in Celsius. If the temperature is below 0, print "It's freezing!"; if it’s between 0 and 30, print "The weather is fine"; and if it’s above 30, print "It's hot!".

### Exercise 4: Store Discounts
A store provides discounts based on the purchase amount:
- Above $100: 10% discount
- Above $200: 20% discount
- Otherwise: No discount

Ask the user for their total purchase amount and display the final price after applying the discount.

### Exercise 5: Animal Classifier
Write a program that asks the user to enter an animal's name ("Dog", "Cat", or "Fish"). Use a `match-case` statement to display a fun fact about the chosen animal.

### **Project: Student Grade Evaluator**

## **Objective:**
Create a Python program that:
- Takes an input grade from the user.
- Converts the numerical grade into a letter grade (A to F).
- Determines if the student has passed or failed (fail if below 50).
- Provides feedback based on the grade range.

---

## **Instructions:**
1. Create a Python program that asks the user to input a numerical grade between 0 and 100.
2. Use selection (IF, ELIF, ELSE) to determine the corresponding letter grade:
   - `A`: 90 - 100
   - `B`: 80 - 89
   - `C`: 70 - 79
   - `D`: 60 - 69
   - `E`: 50 - 59
   - `F`: Below 50 (Fail)
3. Display the letter grade along with a message indicating if the student passed or failed.
4. Add a feature where the program provides feedback:
   - `A`: "Excellent work! Keep it up."
   - `B`: "Great job! Aim for an A."
   - `C`: "Good effort! You can do better."
   - `D`: "Keep working hard. Try to improve."
   - `E`: "You passed, but consider reviewing the material."
   - `F`: "You failed. Study harder next time."
5. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers or numbers above 100).

---

## **Example Output:**
```
Enter your grade: 85
Your letter grade is: B
Great job! Aim for an A.
You have passed.
```

```
Enter your grade: 45
Your letter grade is: F
You failed. Study harder next time.
You have failed.
```

---

## **Bonus Challenge:**
- Modify the program to allow multiple students to input their grades until they choose to stop.
- Display the average grade at the end.
---  


## 8.1.4(c) Iteration  
As stated before, there are three types of loop structures available to perform iterations so that a section of programming code can be repeated under certain conditions.  
These are:  
- Count-controlled loops(for a set number of iterations)
- Pre-condition loops - may have no iterations
- Post-condition loops - always has at least one iteration
  
### Loops in Python

Loops allow programmers to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports three types of loops:

1. **for loop** - Iterates over a sequence.
2. **while loop** - Repeats as long as a condition is true.
3. **do-while loop** (simulated using `while True`) - Ensures the code runs at least once.

## 1. For Loop
A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

### Syntax:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute
```

### Example 1: Iterating over a list
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Example 2: Using `range()`
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

## 2. While Loop
A `while` loop runs as long as a condition is **True**.

### Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute
```

### Example 1: Simple countdown
```python
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
```

### Example 2: User input loop
```python
password = "python123"
user_input = ""
while user_input != password:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
print("Access granted!")
```

## 3. Simulating Do-While Loop
Python does not have a built-in `do-while` loop, but it can be simulated using `while True`.

### Syntax:
```python
while True:
    # Code to execute
    if condition:
        break
```

### Example: Ensuring at least one execution
```python
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter a number greater than 0: "))
    if num > 0:
        print("Valid number entered!")
        break
    print("Try again!")
```

## Comparison Table
| Loop Type | Use Case | Condition Checked | Executes at Least Once |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| for loop | Iterating over a sequence | Before each iteration | No |
| while loop | Repeating based on condition | Before each iteration | No |
| do-while (simulated) | Ensuring at least one execution | After one iteration | Yes |

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a number `n` and calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop.

### Exercise 2: Countdown Timer
Create a countdown timer that starts from a user-inputted number and counts down to zero using a `while` loop.

### Exercise 3: Password Checker
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a password until they enter the correct one using a simulated `do-while` loop.

## 8.1.4(d) Totalling and Counting  

  
## **Totalling**
Totalling refers to the process of accumulating a sum by repeatedly adding values to a total variable. This is commonly used in loops when we need to keep track of running totals.

### **Python**
```python
total_weight = 0  # Initial total weight set to zero

for i in range(5):  # Suppose we enter weights 5 times
    weight = float(input("Enter weight: "))  
    total_weight = total_weight + weight  # Add each new weight to total

print("Total Weight:", total_weight)
```
> **Explanation:**  
> - We initialize `total_weight` to `0`.
> - The user inputs a weight value multiple times.
> - The new weight is added to the total.
> - After the loop ends, we display the final total.

---

### **Visual Basic**
```vb
Dim TotalWeight As Double = 0

For i As Integer = 1 To 5
    Dim Weight As Double = CDbl(Console.ReadLine())
    TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight
Next

Console.WriteLine("Total Weight: " & TotalWeight)
```
> **Same logic as Python:**  
> - `TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight` accumulates the total.

---

### **Java**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double totalWeight = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter weight: ");
            double weight = sc.nextDouble();
            totalWeight = totalWeight + weight;
        }

        System.out.println("Total Weight: " + totalWeight);
    }
}
```
> - The syntax is very similar to Python and Visual Basic.
> - `totalWeight = totalWeight + weight;` accumulates the total.

---

## **Counting**
Counting refers to incrementing a variable to track how many times an event occurs, such as counting user inputs or occurrences of a specific value.

### **Python & Visual Basic**
```python
number_of_items = 0  # Start at zero

for i in range(5):  # Loop runs 5 times
    input("Enter item: ")  
    number_of_items += 1  # Equivalent to number_of_items = number_of_items + 1

print("Total items entered:", number_of_items)
```
> **Shortcut:** `number_of_items += 1` is shorthand for `number_of_items = number_of_items + 1`.

---

### **Java**
Java does things slightly differently:
```java
int numberOfItems = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.print("Enter item: ");
    new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
    numberOfItems++; // Shorthand for numberOfItems = numberOfItems + 1
}

System.out.println("Total items entered: " + numberOfItems);
```
> **Differences in Java:**  
> - Java allows `numberOfItems++;` which is equivalent to `numberOfItems = numberOfItems + 1;`.

---

## **Summary Table**
| Concept   | Python & Visual Basic        | Java Alternative   |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Totalling | `TotalWeight += Weight`      | `TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight;` |
| Counting  | `NumberOfItems += 1`         | `NumberOfItems++;` |

---

- Both **totalling** and **counting** are core concepts in all programming languages.
- Python and Visual Basic use the `+=` shorthand, whereas Java also allows `++` for counting.
- **Understanding these concepts is crucial** when working with loops, as they allow us to track cumulative values and occurrences effectively.
