# 7.5 Validation and verification  
In order for computer system to only accept data inputs that are reasonable and accurate, every item of data needs to be examined before it is accepted by the system.  
Two different methods, with very similar sounding names, are used. For data entry, validation ensures that only data that is reasonabl is accepted.  
Verification is used to check that the data does not change as it is being entered.  

## 7.5.1 Validation  
**Validation** is the automated checking by a program data is reasonable before it is accepted into a computer system. When data is validated by a computer system, if the data is rejected a message should be output explaining why the data was rejected and another opportunity given to enter the data.  

There are many different types of validation checks including:

- **range checks**  
- **length checks**
- **type checks**
- **presence checks**
- **format checks**
- **check digits**

Different types of check may be used on the same piece of data; for example, an examination mark could be checked for reasonableness by using a range check, a type check and a presence check.
