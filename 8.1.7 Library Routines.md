# Library Routines in Programming

Many programming language development systems include library routines that are ready to incorporate into a program. These routines are fully tested and ready to use. A programming language IDE usually includes a standard library of functions and procedures. These standard library routines perform many types of tasks — such as the string handling discussed in Section 8.1.4.

Each programming language has many library routines for standard tasks that are commonly required by programs. Sometimes a set of routines needs to be specifically identified in a program. For example, in Java, the statement:

```java
import java.lang.String;
```

is required at the start of a program to provide access to the string handling library.

## Library Routines You Will Need to Use for IGCSE Computer Science

| Routine | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `MOD`   | Returns the remainder of a division. |
| `DIV`   | Returns the quotient (the whole number part) of a division. |
| `ROUND` | Returns a value rounded to a given number of decimal places. |
| `RANDOM`| Returns a random number. |

## Examples of Library Routines in Pseudocode

- `Value1 ← MOD(10, 3)`  
  Returns the remainder of 10 divided by 3 (result: `1`).

- `Value2 ← DIV(10, 3)`  
  Returns the quotient of 10 divided by 3 (result: `3`).

- `Value3 ← ROUND(6.97354)`  
  Returns the value rounded to 2 decimal places (result: `6.97`).

- `Value4 ← RANDOM()`  
  Returns a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive (example result: `0.42`).

## Notes

- `MOD` and `DIV` are extremely useful for integer division tasks.
- `ROUND` is important when working with real numbers and formatting output.
- `RANDOM` is essential for simulations, games, and any situation where unpredictability is needed.

# Library Routines in Python

Many programming language development systems include library routines that are ready to incorporate into a program.  
These routines are fully tested and ready to use.

In Python, many of these routines are already part of the **standard library** or built into the language itself.

Here are some important library routines for **IGCSE Computer Science** you should know:

| Routine | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `MOD` | Returns remainder of a division |
| `DIV` | Returns the whole number part (quotient) of a division |
| `ROUND` | Rounds a value to a given number of decimal places |
| `RANDOM` | Returns a random number |

# Examples of Library Routines in Python

## MOD - Remainder of Division

The `%` operator in Python gives the remainder of a division.  
Example: `10 % 3` returns `1` because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

```python
# MOD Example
value1 = 10 % 3
print("Remainder of 10 divided by 3:", value1)  
```

# Practical Use of Library Routines in Python

The following examples show how to use MOD, DIV, ROUND, and RANDOM in simple mini-programs.

```python
import random  # import random library at the start

# ===== MOD Example: Check if a number is even or odd =====
# The % operator gives the remainder of a division.
# If remainder is 0 when divided by 2, the number is even.
number = int(input("Enter a number to check even or odd: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd.")

# ===== DIV Example: Divide apples among friends =====
# The // operator gives the whole number part (quotient) of a division.
apples = int(input("\nEnter number of apples: "))
friends = int(input("Enter number of friends: "))
whole_apples_per_friend = apples // friends
print(f"Each friend gets {whole_apples_per_friend} whole apples.")

# ===== ROUND Example: Round a price to 2 decimal places =====
# round(number, decimals) rounds to the specified number of decimals.
price = float(input("\nEnter the price: "))
rounded_price = round(price, 2)
print(f"Rounded price: {rounded_price:.2f}")

# ===== RANDOM Example: Generate a lucky number =====
# random.random() generates a random float between 0 and 1.
# To make it between 1 and 100, multiply by 100 and use round.
lucky_number = round(random.random() * 100)
print(f"\nYour lucky number is: {lucky_number}")
```
