# 8.1.7 Library routines  
Many programming language development systems include library routines that are ready to incorporate into a program. These routines are fully tested and ready to use. A programming language IDE usually includes a standard library of functions and procedures. These standard library routines perform many types of task - such as the string handling discussed in Section 8.1.4.  

    
Each programming language has many library routines for standard tasks that are commonly required by programs. Sometimes a set of routines needs to be specifically identified in a program. For example, in Java, the statement **import java.lang.String;** is required at the start of a program to provide access to the string handling library.    
  
  
  You will need to use these library routines in your programs for IGCSE Computer Science:   
   
- **MOD** - Returns remainder of a division  
- **DIV** - returns the quotient (i.e) the whole number part) of a divions  
- **ROUND** - return a value rounded to a given number of decimal places  
- **RANDOM** - returns a random number  
  
Here are some examples of these library routines in pseudocode:  
Value1 ← MOD(10, 3) returns the remainder of 10 divided by 3  
Value2 ← DIV(10, 3) returns the quotient of 10 divided by 3  
Value3 ← ROUND(6.97354) returns the value rounded to 2 decimal places  
Value3 ← RANDOM() returns a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive
