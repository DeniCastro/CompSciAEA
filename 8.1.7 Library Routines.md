# Library Routines in Programming

Many programming language development systems include library routines that are ready to incorporate into a program. These routines are fully tested and ready to use. A programming language IDE usually includes a standard library of functions and procedures. These standard library routines perform many types of tasks — such as the string handling discussed in Section 8.1.4.

Each programming language has many library routines for standard tasks that are commonly required by programs. Sometimes a set of routines needs to be specifically identified in a program. For example, in Java, the statement:

```java
import java.lang.String;
```

is required at the start of a program to provide access to the string handling library.

## Library Routines You Will Need to Use for IGCSE Computer Science

| Routine | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `MOD`   | Returns the remainder of a division. |
| `DIV`   | Returns the quotient (the whole number part) of a division. |
| `ROUND` | Returns a value rounded to a given number of decimal places. |
| `RANDOM`| Returns a random number. |

## Examples of Library Routines in Pseudocode

- `Value1 ← MOD(10, 3)`  
  Returns the remainder of 10 divided by 3 (result: `1`).

- `Value2 ← DIV(10, 3)`  
  Returns the quotient of 10 divided by 3 (result: `3`).

- `Value3 ← ROUND(6.97354)`  
  Returns the value rounded to 2 decimal places (result: `6.97`).

- `Value4 ← RANDOM()`  
  Returns a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive (example result: `0.42`).

## Notes

- `MOD` and `DIV` are extremely useful for integer division tasks.
- `ROUND` is important when working with real numbers and formatting output.
- `RANDOM` is essential for simulations, games, and any situation where unpredictability is needed.
