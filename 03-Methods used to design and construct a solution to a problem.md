# Methods Used to Design and Construct a Solution to a Problem

Solutions to problems need to be designed and developed rigorously. The use of formal methods enables the process to be clearly shown for others to understand the proposed solution. The following methods need to be used by IGCSE Computer Science students:

- **Structure Diagrams**
- **Flowcharts**
- **Pseudocode**

## Structure Diagrams

Structure diagrams can be used to show top-down design in a diagrammatic form. Structure diagrams are hierarchical, showing how a computer system solution can be divided into sub-systems with each level giving a more detailed breakdown. If necessary, each sub-system can be further divided.

</div>

## Example 2: Alarm app for a smartphone 
Consider the alarm app computer system for a smart phone; this could be divided into three sub-systems, setting the alarm, checking for the alarm time, sounding the alarm. These sub-systems could then be further sub-divided; a structure diagram makes the process clearer.

</div>  

## Flowcharts
A flowchart shows diagrammatically the steps required to complete a task and the order that they are to be performed. These steps, together with the order, are called an algorithm. Flowcharts are an effective way to communicate how the algorithm that makes up a system or sub-system works.

  ### Checking for the alarm time  
  Have a look at a flowchart showing how the checking for the alarm time sub-system works.

</div>  

### Flowcharts

Flowcharts are drawn using standard flowchart symbols.

- **Begin/End**  
  Terminator flowchart symbols are used at the beginning and end of each flowchart.

  <div align="center">

</div> 

### Process  
**Process flowchart symbols** are used to show actions, for example, when values are assigned to variables. If a process has been defined elsewhere then the name of that process is shown.  

<div align="center">

</div>   

### Input and output  
The same flowchart symbol is used to show the input of data and output of information.   
  
<div align="center">

</div>  

### Decision
**Decision flowchart symbols** are used to decide which action is to be taken next; these can be used for selection and repetition/iteration. There are always two outputs from a decision flowchart symbol.
