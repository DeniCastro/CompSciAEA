# Methods Used to Design and Construct a Solution to a Problem

Solutions to problems need to be designed and developed rigorously. The use of formal methods enables the process to be clearly shown for others to understand the proposed solution. The following methods need to be used by IGCSE Computer Science students:

- **Structure Diagrams**
- **Flowcharts**
- **Pseudocode**

## Structure Diagrams

Structure diagrams can be used to show top-down design in a diagrammatic form. Structure diagrams are hierarchical, showing how a computer system solution can be divided into sub-systems with each level giving a more detailed breakdown. If necessary, each sub-system can be further divided.
