## Concepts

So far, you have tested your algorithms by dry-running. Once you have written a program for your algorithm, and when there are no syntax errors, you will now use a computer to run the program to complete the task exactly as you have written it; you may need to make some changes before it works exactly as you intend it to.

This chapter will introduce you to the programming concepts required for practical use of a high-level language. This chapter shows the concepts behind such programming languages but should be used in conjunction with learning the syntax of an appropriate programming language.

There are many high-level programming languages to choose from. For IGCSE Computer Science, the high-level programming languages recommended are **Python**, **Visual Basic**, or **Java**. The use of these languages is also required for A Level Computer Science.

Many programming languages need an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** to write and run code. IDEs are free to download and use.

### Python will be the primary programming language used in this IGCSE course because:
- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it ideal for beginners.
- **Versatile**: It is used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **Wide Community Support**: Python has a large community, so finding help and resources is easy.
- **Free and Open Source**: Python is free to use and distribute.

# Python Programming for IGCSE

## Introduction

In this IGCSE Computer Science course, we will use **Python** as our programming language. Python is a popular, beginner-friendly language known for its simplicity and readability. Throughout this course, you will learn how to write and understand Python code to solve problems and complete tasks.

## Data Types in Python

In Python, data types refer to the kind of value a variable can hold. Here are some of the basic data types we will work with:

### 1. Integer (int)
Integers are whole numbers (positive or negative) without decimals.

**Example:**
```python
# Integer example
number = 10
print(number)  # Output: 10
```

### 2. Float (float)
Floats are numbers with decimal points.

**Example:**
```python
# Float example
pi = 3.14
print(pi)  # Output: 3.14
```

### 3. String (str)
Strings are sequences of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) enclosed in quotes.

**Example:**
```python
# String example
name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Output: Alice
```

### 4. Boolean (bool)
Booleans represent **True** or **False** values. They are useful for decision-making.

**Example:**
```python
# Boolean example
is_python_fun = True
print(is_python_fun)  # Output: True
```

### 5. List (list)
Lists store multiple items in a single variable. Items in a list are ordered and can be changed.

**Example:**
```python
# List example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### 6. Tuple (tuple)
Tuples are like lists but **cannot** be changed (they are immutable).

**Example:**
```python
# Tuple example
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates)  # Output: (10, 20)
```

### 7. Dictionary (dict)
Dictionaries store data in **key-value** pairs.

**Example:**
```python
# Dictionary example
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 16}
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 16}
```

## Summary

Understanding these basic data types is crucial for writing Python programs. You will use them to store and manipulate data throughout the course. Practice working with these examples and ensure you understand how to declare and print each type.

In the next lessons, we will explore how to combine these data types with Python logic to create more complex programs.
