# 8.1.8 Creating a maintainable program  
Once a program is written, it may need to be maintained or updated by another programmer at a later date. The programmer may have no documentation other than a copy of the source program. Even a programmer looking at their own program several years later may have forgotten exactly how all the tasks in it were complemented!  
A maintainable program should:  
### **Always use meaningful identifier names for:**  
- variables  
- constants  
- arrays  
- procedures  
- functions  
  
be divided into modules for each task using:  
- procedures  
- functions  
  
**be fully commented using your programming language's commenting feature.**  
  
Below is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of test scores. It follows maintainability principles:  

```python
# Program: Calculate Average Score
# Author: Unknown
# Date: 2025-05-08
# Description: This program takes a list of test scores and calculates the average.

# CONSTANTS
MAX_SCORE = 100  # Maximum possible score for validation

# Function to validate that all scores are within a valid range
def validate_scores(scores):
    """
    Validates that all scores are between 0 and MAX_SCORE.
    Returns True if valid, otherwise False.
    """
    for score in scores:
        if score < 0 or score > MAX_SCORE:
            return False
    return True

# Function to calculate average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(scores):
    """
    Returns the average of a list of numbers.
    Assumes the list is not empty.
    """
    total = sum(scores)
    return total / len(scores)

# Main procedure
def main():
    """
    Main program to get scores, validate them, and calculate the average.
    """
    test_scores = [88, 92, 79, 93, 85]  # Example data
    if validate_scores(test_scores):
        average = calculate_average(test_scores)
        print(f"The average score is {average:.2f}")
    else:
        print("Error: One or more scores are out of range.")

# Run the main procedure
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```  

```
Programming examples for MOD, DIV, ROUND and RANDOM  
Value1 = 10%3  
Value2 = 10//3  
Value = divmod(10,3)  
Value3 = round(6.97354, 2)  
from random import random  
Value4 = random()    

```
```
Python - MOD uses the % operator and DIV the // operator  
The function divmod(x,y) provides both answers where the first answer is DIV and the second answer is MOD  
RANDOM needs to import the library routine random, and then the function: random() can be used afterwards
```
## Activity 8.20  
Write and test a program in Python to:
- input two integers a and b and then find a MOD b and a DIV b  
- create a random integer between 100 and 300
- Hint: search for the "try:" use in python
